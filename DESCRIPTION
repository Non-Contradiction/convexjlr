Description: Provides a simple high-level wrapper for
    'Julia' package 'Convex.jl' (see <https://github.com/JuliaOpt/Convex.jl> for
    more information),
    which makes it easy to describe and solve convex optimization problems in R.
    The problems can be dealt with include:
    linear programs,
    second-order cone programs,
    semidefinite programs,
    exponential cone programs.
